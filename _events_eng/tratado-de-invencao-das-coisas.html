synopsis: "<p>Tratado da Invenção das coisas (Treaty of the Invention of Things) is
  the invention of things on my skin with tattoos. When we say things, we can be referring
  to lots of things. Things are somehow nameless, undefined, apart from this generic
  cluster we call things — objects, tales, ideas, materials, images, postponed projects,
  thoughts, and many others. </p><p>Tratado da Invenção das coisas is this accumulation
  of small narratives tattooed on my body as I was inventing and understanding myself.
  I was interested in the act of inventing, in inventing my body, and understanding
  from within the History of Tattoo, my autobiography and the nature of things. Strange
  invention, this one; made of pain. The invention of myself, made with needles and
  ink. My body would not exist, if it weren’t for these wounds I invented. This body
  is tattooed with my affections and with what affects me, whether they are real or
  fictional. While I was getting tattooed, I was thinking that this inscription on
  my body was a way of understanding myself and my life, and simultaneously a way
  of seeing the world. I can claim a symbolic meaning from the images on my skin,
  but I’m not sure it is up to me to decide. I cannot say that I own my tattoos; they’re
  simultaneously in me and beyond me, as images with stories and connotations that
  my body cannot fully define.</p><p>Tratado da Invenção das coisas is a performance
  anchored on this experience of the body. Tratado da Invenção das coisas is this
  invention of a life, a living encyclopedia of my understanding of things.</p><p><br></p>"
