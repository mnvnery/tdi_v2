synopsis: "<p>ƎSPÉCIE does not refer to the identifiable, but to what belongs to us
  and we do not know about. At the unlikely instant when the visible touches, crosses
  and is confused with the invisible. Its dramaturgy is structured by subtractions,
  the aesthetic experience is installed as a challenge. Its first movement is that
  of the darkness that invades the spaces of the gaze of the observer. An invitation
  to diving and immersing in a territory of the possible. In search of other ways
  of seeing, of experiencing absences as fields of knowledge that are yet to be recognized,
  and through them try to practice some silence as collective speech. In an unlikely
  way, light the flash that pops from this intimate and face-to-face encounter with
  a body in a continuous state of transformation and metamorphosis, in successive
  acts of abandonment, of construction and collapse, of appearance and disappearance.
  Encounter with an open body that escapes identity accommodation and meanings, but
  creates a universe where images are embodied and presented. Like the animal, the
  woman and the elder, who among others shuffle like a carousel, in a diffuse trajectory,
  in a flow that transposes the looks in the precise duration of the act of investigation
  of the performer’s body, by the performer’s own body. That when transiting through
  sensory-perceptual states makes explicit the unique and singular ability to transubstantiate
  their materiality, to externalize in actions the liquids inside - the saliva, sweat,
  tears, the emptiness of the room makes the noise of swallowing saliva seem like
  a frog. A moment of astonishment: who watches who? The work proposes to refrain
  from any artifice, including usual technical resources of the theatre, so that each
  movement, or scenic act, focuses attention on the dynamics and particularities of
  the body and its relations with space. ƎSPÉCIE is an adventure of life stuck on
  its surface, of the forces of existence in its multiple, mysterious, strange condition
  of being in front, intimate and open to what is alive and instinctual.</p><p><br></p>"
