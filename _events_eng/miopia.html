synopsis: '<p>In this performance, we watch the recording of episode 500 of MiaPia,
  a popular television programme. Between culinary moments, unusual guests and tarot
  players, we accompany Mia and her difficulties in relating to some of the most pressing
  problems in the world: environmental issues, social inequality, gender inequality,
  structural racism, wars and (blah, blah, blah). Isn’t this what we sometimes tend
  to "see" in this inventory? A vague, dull "blah-blah, blah”?</p><p>Why?</p><p>In
  the 500th episode, Mia will challenge the short-sighted reflex that blurs her gaze
  and, despite the pains in her eyes and chest, courageously explores the reach and
  the limits of her vision. Welcome to MiaPia, your evening show!</p>'
