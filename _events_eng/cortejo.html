synopsis: "<p>CORTEJO is a film/book that is part of the performance held in the gardens
  of Palácio de Cristal, where the Portuguese Colonial Exhibition of 1934 took place.
  In CORTEJO, the spaces and ideas of the exhibition are emphasized by the absence
  of buildings and bodies or by their replacement through new themes. The evocation
  of the ruins or the empty spaces is the logic that drives the entire route.</p><p><br></p>"
