  title: TDI 20 years, what next?
  datas: 'MOMENT I: MAY 3 to JUNE 19 2022'
  info: "<p>sa·ú·de<br>(latin <em>sanitas</em>, -<em>atis</em>, de <em>sanus, </em>sain)</p><p>Saúde
    (health) is, in Portuguese as in English, a noun meaning: the condition of a person’s
    body and mind; an interjection−cheers. There is also the English proverb “drink
    (to) someone’s health”.</p><p>TEMPS D'IMAGES Lisboa celebrates with this edition
    twenty years of life.<br>As everything alive, this festival has passed through
    many phases, but always as a whole. A set of parts and elements, all of which
    are both interlinked and interdependent; conveyed with acceptance and adaptability.</p><p>The
    festival started out as part of an international network of which it is the only
    survivor, yet it still retains the interest and drive that continues to keep it
    progressing and alive.</p><p>There are many salutes to be made.</p><p>Firstly,
    a toast to all the artists that accepted the challenge and continue to do so with
    such remarkable tenacity. With a mix of artists presenting their work for the
    first time and those with many years of experience, this festival shows that they
    have continued to find the strength and opportunity to take risks once again.<br>They
    have discovered new things, experimented, created and exhibited.<br>They celebrate
    life. <em>Saúde!</em></p><p>Secondly, many thanks to all our partners over these
    past years. They have opened their doors and invested their resources and work.
    Their effort has been vital to our activity, our strength. We wish them many happy
    years to come.</p><p>Now, to our funders, whose contributions are so important
    for the value of the work developed in our sector, and for their understanding
    of its importance. To the future!</p><p>Celebrate remembering and find the time
    to do it. When someone or something is born, when there is an anniversary, when
    there is a date, when a commemorative element is unfurled or a flag is waved,
    when there is an ending or an opening.</p><p>An important part of these moments
    is to keep alive the question: what next?</p>"
